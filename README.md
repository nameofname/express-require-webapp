#Test Node App

Playing around with new and different web technologies. 
Doing some tests with require.js, web sockets. My final answer? Web sockets are awesome, require.js is not for me.
Future Ronald : Feel free to put anything in here you want to test with. No worries.


###Dependencies
* Node.js
* Express
* *Prefer to use Supervisor to watch the node server*
