#Test Node App

Playing around with new and different web technologies. 
My goal is to set up a simple SPA webapp that serves pages using require.js. Nothing fancy. 


###Dependencies
* Node.js
* Express
* *Prefer to use Supervisor to watch the node server*


```javascript
function ronald()
{
    console.log('derf');
}
```
